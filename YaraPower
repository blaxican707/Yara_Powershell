invoke-command installs yara objects to remote computer, executes and then generates computers that have
the IOC's present on them. Also in the scriptblock { }, you can put whatever directory you have as long ass the yara files are present in them. Finally, Computers with IOC will be generated to the .csv file.

IMPORTANT!!! Note - that the PS1 script may echo red error message stating "The term C:\test\yara.exe" is not recognized as the anme of a cmdlet, function, script file or operable program". However, the script does work and it will generate an accurate "Match.csv" along with the computerlist.txt file. This error is intermitant and it does not disrupt or degrade the mission of the script
